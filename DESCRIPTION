Description: Depicts individual study courses per day.  Pre-specified
    events on certain days, for example drug intake, efficacy, or safety
    events, are indicated by colored lines.  The detection of patterns
    in the data or the temporal connection of study procedures and outcome
    events is supported by several functions, such as sorting, grouping,
    and changing the complexity of the graphical display.
