## Description

A 'megaplot' is a 'shiny' application and as the name suggests,
is a huge graphical display showing individual-level data over time
interactively. In the context of clinical trials, megaplots seek to
represent longitudinal data while focusing on event visualization 
for each subject throughout the entire course of the trial. 

The concept of the megaplots app has been re-designed at the end of 2025.
If you want to use the previous version, please use 'Release version v.1.1.10'.

## Getting Started

The package megaplots is available on 'github' and may be installed using

install_github("Bayer-Group/BIC-Megaplots")

respectively.

After installation megaplots can be started using

library("megaplots")

run_app()

The application will start showing the data upload page. For detailed information on how to upload data see next section.

## File Upload & Variable Selection

Once the 'megaplots' package is installed, simply call this 
application through the function run_app(). 
Next, upload the dataset through the 'File upload'-panel. 

Please click on the "Browse..." button and upload the desired data set.
Currently, it is only possible to use '.RData' as data format.
If other formats are used, an error message appears.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/1_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

After successful upload, options for the variable selection will appear.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/4_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

The variable 'Identifier' can be a numeric or character variable and will be used
to assign individual time sequences.
The variables 'Timeline Start Day' and 'Timeline End Day' define the start and end time of every
individual time course. Both variables should be integers, otherwise they
will be rounded.
'Event' and 'Event Group' should contain the names of the events that are displayed.
Multiple events can belong to a specific event group. If no event group is selected,
event is automatically set as event group.
The event names do not necessarily have to be unique. For display purposes, they
are renamed if non-unique, by writing the event group in brackets after them.
Like the time courses, every event requires a start and end day. The corresponding
variables can be selected via 'Event Start Day' and 'Event End Day'.
The same rounding procedure is applied as for the timelines.

For more detailed information about the data structure see [Input Data](#Input Data). below.

In every variable selection drop-down menu there is a 'Clear' button to delete the selected variable.
When all variables are in the desired a format a next button appears in the lower half of the screen, which leads to the next panel the 'Event & color selection'.

## Event & Color Selection 

In this panel, the events that should be displayed can be selected. Events can 
also be sorted and all event colors can be defined. All settings can be saved so 
that they can be quickly reloaded in future sessions. 
First, the events are selected on the left side.

### Event / Event Group Tree

On the left side appears a list with checkboxes for all event groups.
Clicking on a box selects all events of the event group. The small arrows next 
to the box can be used to expand the list. Then also every event appears in the list.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/7_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

This can be used to select only individual events of a event group.
To find individual events or event groups in a long list, the search box above
the list can be used. For every selected event a colored box appears right to 
the event selection list. These can be used to set the colors (see next chapter).

Another feature is the 'drag and drop' of the events within the list. This 
can be used to sort events within a event group. This can be particularly helpful 
for ordinal scaled events. Sorting affects the legend displayed next to the graph but
can also be used to create a color palette explained in the next chapter.
After sorting, any box of the event selection list must be clicked again to update the color selection.
Further known issues with the drag & drop feature are that no events may be selected in order
to move variables and events can be dragged out of the event group, which leads to errors.

After completing the event selection, it is possible to go directly to the megaplot graphic
by clicking the next button, or make various color settings, which are explained in the 
next section.

### Event / Event Group Color List
In the middle of the 'Event & color selection'-panel, a colored list with all 
selected event groups and events appears. It is now possible to mark an 
event group or a single event by clicking on the corresponding event/event group name.
The selected event or event group gets a highlighted border.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/10_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

By clicking one of these events a color selection panel on the right side appears.
Depending on whether a single event or a event group is clicked, the options in 
the color selection panel differ.

Note: If you change the event selection on the left side after making a selection for the colors in the middle, 
it may happen that a event/event group selection does not respond. 
By clicking any other event in the color list updates the selection and resolve the issue.

### Color Selection Panel

After selecting an event or event group in the color list, options to change the colors
appear on the right side. There is also an jitter option to adjust the event position
of the event group, which will be explained in the chapter after next.

### Color Methods

Selecting suitable colors is particularly difficult when many different events are to be
represented. The user is responsible for selecting suitable colors and take color blindness into
account. For the correct color selection, please refer to the various best practice guides.
The methods here are only intended as an aid to their implementation.

When an event group is selected, there are three different methods to colorize the events:
'Color gradient (3 colors)', 'Unique color for all events withing group' and 
'Distinct color by selected palette'.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/11_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

When using color gradient, three color inputs appear which will define a color palette displayed 
below. In this example, the colors yellow, gray and turquoise are used. 
Depending on how many events are there within an event group, there are that many colors, created 
by these three colors. By clicking one of these color inputs a color palette appears which 
can be used to change the colors and their saturation. However, it is also possible to directly 
access a color hexcode into the color box.
Once a satisfactory color palette has been found, click the 'Update colors' button to apply the
changes. 

The second option 'Unique color for all events within group' obviously colors all events
of an event group in the same color. So there will be exactly one color input.
Here too, the color can be selected using the palette or by entering the hexcode.

The third option 'Distinct color by selected palette' brings up another drop-down menu
'Select color palette' where predefined color palettes can be selected. By selecting
one of these palettes a good visulization is not guaranteed and must be ensured by the 
user.


If an single event is selected in the color list the color selection on the right
will be the same for 'Unique color for all events within group' explained above. 
So it is possible to first create a color palette for the complete event group and after
that change individual colors by selection the event.

### Offset Events

In order to better distinguish events in addition to color, they are also slightly offset 
in height by default. To prevent this, the check mark can be removed for option "Offset events for event group".

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/18_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="50%"/> 

The offset position will be the same for each time course. An offset position for events
within an event group only makes sense if different events at a given
day can appear. For unique events within a event group, it is recommended to disable this option.

### Save & Upload Color Files 
Once all color settings have been made, they can be saved via the 'save color file'-button.
<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/19_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="20%"/> 
This saves a data frame as '.rds'-file including the selected event and event group, the selected color
and if available all three selected gradient color and also the logical value if variables should be
offset.

To upload the saved color settings in a new session use the 'Upload saved color file'-file input like the 
data upload.

## Megaplots
In this chapter the main graphical display will be explained.
The megaplot  is a huge graphical display used to show individual-level data over time.
The megaplots uses horizontal lines to represent individual trajectories and events of any identifier over days (in clinical trial context: study units).

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/23_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

The legend on the right side can be used to select and deselect event groups to provide an better
overview. Selecting a high number of events can lead to overlaying event lines. In this case
it is recommended to focus on a few number of event/event groups or zoom-in on the graphic
accordingly.

For every single event displayed a hover panel is available with information about the 
identifier, the event name as well as the start and end time. It is also possible to use the mouse hover
for the individual timelines, however these are only visible when hovering near the start or end of 
the line.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/25_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

In addition to hovering, you can also click on event lines. The complete clicked event are then highlighted in comparison to other events. It is possible to click on and highlight as many events as desired.
To undo the effect, double-click on the plot window. 
Note: The zoom setting will also be reset by double-clicking.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/27_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

There are several ways to zoom-in to the graphic. First, it is possible to use 
mouse-scrolling to zoom-in.
To re-scale only one axis, click and drag near the edge of one of the axes.
If the drag mode is set to 'pan' (see chapter Plot options) it is possible to click 
and drag on the plot. 
Another zoom possibility is to click and drag on the plot when option 'Zoom' is selected.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/28_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

Third way to zoom is to use the 'plus' or 'minus' button on the modebar to zoom-in or zoom-out.

Further options for this megaplots graph are described in the chapter "Sidebar Options", such
as sorting, grouping or line thickness.

## Sidebar Options
Various options are available on the sidebar, which would be 'Sorting/Grouping',
'Plot appearance', 'Filter' and 'Download'.
Each of these option panels is explained in a separate chapter below.

### Sorting / Grouping
When you click on 'Sorting/Grouping', a panel opens with the three inputs:
'Sorting variable', 'Grouping variable' and 'Arrange Groups'. 
In the sorting variable input every numeric variable of the uploaded data set is eligible.
Therefore custom sorting variables can be created in the data preparation.

All character variables in the upload data can be a grouping variable. If a grouping
variable is selected, the time-courses are splitted by all variable values.

<img src="inst/app/www/Screenshots/36_Megaplots.png" align="center" width="95%"/> 

It is also possibly to select multiple grouping variables. Then the option 'Arrange groups'
might be of interest, as it allows the groups to be reordered.
This can be done simply by dragging and dropping the displayed group boxes.
